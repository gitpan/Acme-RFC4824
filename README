Acme-RFC4824

Acme::RFC4824 is a module that tries to help you with the implementation
of RFC 4824 - IP over Semaphore Flag Signaling System.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

SIGNALING

If you don't care about the module's details and just want to use it
for routing IP over SFSS, you can use the scripts in the example
directory (note that you need Net::Pcap for them):

# ipsfss_receive.pl <interface> [filter]
Receives packets from an interface and shows you what to signal. So
say you want to signal all packets to 10.23.23.23 arriving on en0, just
use
# ipsfss_receive.pl en0 "ip and dst 10.23.23.23"

# ipsfss_send.pl <interface> <source MAC> <destination MAC>
If you receive signals from someone, you can use ipsfss_send.pl to
convert those frames into IP packets. Say you accept frames for 
01:23:45:67:89:0a and your MAC is 00:11:22:33:44:55:66, you can run it
as 
# ipsfss_send.pl en0 00:11:22:33:44:55:66 01:23:45:67:89:0a

Please note that both example programs assume an interface which
either is or looks like Ethernet.
